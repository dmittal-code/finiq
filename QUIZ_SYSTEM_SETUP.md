# Quiz System Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the complete implementation of the FinIQ Quiz System, which includes:
- **Database Tables**: Quizzes, Questions, Question Options, and Quiz-Question relationships
- **30+ Sample Questions**: Across 7 financial categories and 3 difficulty levels
- **15 Pre-built Quizzes**: Covering beginner to advanced topics
- **Comprehensive API Library**: Complete CRUD operations with advanced features
- **Admin Interface**: Full management system (to be implemented)
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Database-driven quiz experience

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Database Setup

1. **Run the main SQL script** in your Supabase SQL editor:
   ```bash
   # Copy contents of quiz-system-setup.sql and run in Supabase
   ```

2. **Run the supplementary SQL script** to complete question options:
   ```bash
   # Copy contents of quiz-system-options-supplement.sql and run in Supabase
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Database Setup

Run this query in Supabase to verify everything was created correctly:
```sql
-- Check tables were created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('quizzes', 'questions', 'question_options', 'quiz_questions');

-- Check data was inserted
SELECT 
  'Quizzes' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM quizzes
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Questions', COUNT(*) FROM questions
UNION ALL  
SELECT 
  'Question Options', COUNT(*) FROM question_options
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Quiz Questions', COUNT(*) FROM quiz_questions;
```

Expected results:
- **4 tables** created
- **15 quizzes** inserted
- **30+ questions** inserted
- **100+ question options** inserted
- **Quiz-question relationships** established

## üîß Next Steps

### 1. Update Quiz Interface

Update `src/app/quizzes/QuizzesPageClient.tsx` to use the database:

```typescript
import { getQuizzes, getQuizzesByDifficulty } from '../../lib/quizzes';

// Replace hard-coded quiz data with database calls
const [quizzes, setQuizzes] = useState<Quiz[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  async function loadQuizzes() {
    try {
      const data = await getQuizzes();
      setQuizzes(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error loading quizzes:', error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }
  loadQuizzes();
}, []);
```

### 2. Implement Quiz Taking Interface

Create a new component for taking quizzes:

```typescript
// src/app/quizzes/[id]/QuizTakingComponent.tsx
import { getQuizWithQuestions, checkQuizAnswer, calculateQuizScore } from '../../../lib/quizzes';

// Implement quiz-taking logic with:
// - Question navigation
// - Answer selection
// - Timer functionality  
// - Score calculation
// - Results display with explanations
```

### 3. Create Admin Interface

Following the pattern from flashcards and terms admin:

```
src/app/admin/quizzes/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx                    # Quiz management dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AdminQuizzesPageClient.tsx  # Main quiz admin interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ add/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx               # Add new quiz page
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AddQuizPageClient.tsx  # Quiz creation form
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ edit/[id]/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx               # Edit quiz page  
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EditQuizPageClient.tsx # Quiz editing form

src/app/admin/questions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx                     # Question management dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AdminQuestionsPageClient.tsx # Main question admin interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ add/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx                # Add new question page
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AddQuestionPageClient.tsx # Question creation form
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ edit/[id]/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx                # Edit question page
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EditQuestionPageClient.tsx # Question editing form
```

### 4. Enhance Navigation

Update `src/app/NavBar.tsx` to include admin quiz/question management links for admins.

## üé® Advanced Features

### Smart Quiz Generation
The system supports dynamic quiz creation:
```typescript
// Generate a custom quiz from question bank
const customQuiz = await generateQuizFromBank(
  'Investing',    // category filter
  'intermediate', // difficulty filter  
  10             // number of questions
);
```

### Question Analytics
Track question performance over time:
```typescript
// Update stats after each quiz completion
await updateQuestionStats(questionId, wasCorrect);

// View comprehensive statistics
const stats = await getQuizStatistics();
```

### Flexible Question Types
- **Single Choice**: Traditional multiple choice with one correct answer
- **Multiple Choice**: Select all correct answers
- **True/False**: Binary choice questions

### Quiz Randomization
Quizzes can randomize question order to prevent memorization and ensure varied experiences.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Errors**: Ensure all TypeScript types are properly imported
2. **Database Connection**: Verify Supabase connection and table permissions
3. **Missing Questions**: Run the supplementary SQL script for complete question options
4. **Quiz-Question Relationships**: Verify the junction table has proper foreign key constraints

### Debugging Queries

Check data integrity:
```sql
-- Find questions without options
SELECT q.id, q.question_text 
FROM questions q
LEFT JOIN question_options qo ON q.id = qo.question_id
WHERE qo.id IS NULL;

-- Find quizzes without questions  
SELECT qz.id, qz.title
FROM quizzes qz
LEFT JOIN quiz_questions qq ON qz.id = qq.quiz_id  
WHERE qq.id IS NULL;
```
