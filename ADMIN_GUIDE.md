## Best Practices

### Writing Good Definitions

1. **Be Clear**: Use simple, understandable language
2. **Be Comprehensive**: Cover the key aspects of the term
3. **Be Accurate**: Ensure information is correct and up-to-date
4. **Be Concise**: Keep definitions focused and to the point

### Creating Helpful Examples

1. **Use Real Scenarios**: Provide practical, relatable examples
2. **Include Numbers**: Use specific amounts when relevant
3. **Show Context**: Explain when and why the concept applies
4. **Keep it Simple**: Avoid overly complex scenarios

### Managing Related Terms

1. **Choose Relevant Terms**: Only include closely related concepts
2. **Use Consistent Naming**: Match the exact term names used elsewhere
3. **Limit Quantity**: 3-5 related terms is usually sufficient
4. **Cross-Reference**: Ensure related terms exist in your glossary

## Data Management

### Backup Considerations

- All data is stored in your Supabase database
- Supabase provides automatic backups
- Consider exporting data periodically for additional safety

### Performance Tips

- The admin interface loads all terms at once for fast filtering
- Large numbers of terms may require pagination in the future
- Search is performed client-side for immediate results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Terms not saving**: Check that all required fields are filled
2. **Related terms not adding**: Ensure the term isn't already added
3. **Categories not showing**: Verify the category is selected from the dropdown
4. **Page not loading**: Check your Supabase connection and environment variables

### Error Messages

- **"Failed to create term"**: Database connection issue or validation error
- **"Term not found"**: The term ID in the URL is invalid
- **"Failed to load terms"**: Database connection or permission issue

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The admin interface currently has no authentication. Consider implementing:

1. **User Authentication**: Require login to access admin features
2. **Role-Based Access**: Limit admin access to authorized users
3. **API Protection**: Secure your Supabase RLS policies
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure sensitive data is properly configured

## Future Enhancements

- **Audit Trail**: Track changes and who made them
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search with filters
- **Term Analytics**: View usage statistics and popular terms
- **Content Moderation**: Review and approve new terms
- **Rich Text Editor**: Enhanced formatting for definitions and examples
